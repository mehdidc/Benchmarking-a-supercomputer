title: Benchmarking our supercomputers
author: Alexandre Strube^1^\footnote{Corresponding author – a.strube@fz-juelich.de}
abstract : This is a first attempt to organize my thoughts on my current work with creating and tuning benchmarks which show me our supercomputers' software and hardware health. The idea is to have a set of benchmarks based on real codes which allow me to see, in a short glance, if everything is fine.

# Introduction

Test [@doi:10.1177/109434208900300302], has become a popular shaping route for all kinds of macroporous materials. The process is based on the segregation of matter (particles or solute) by growing crystals in a suspension or solution (Fig. 1). After complete solidification, the solvent crystals are removed by sublimation. The porosity obtained is thus an almost direct replica of the solvent crystals.
